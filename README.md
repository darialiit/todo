# Todo App
This project was created to practice and demonstrate proficiency in JavaScript, focusing on object-oriented programming, DOM manipulation, and local storage. The primary objective was to build a functional Todo List application that allows users to manage tasks efficiently. This project was completed as part of the JavaScript course: [The Odin Project](https://www.theodinproject.com/lessons/node-path-javascript-todo-list). The code was written independently, based on the concepts studied in the course.

## Key Features
- **Dynamic Todos**: Todos are dynamically created using classes, each having properties like title, description, dueDate, and priority.
- **Project Management**: Users can create multiple projects, with a default project available on initial load. Todos can be assigned to specific projects.
- **Task Viewing**: View all projects and the associated todos within each project, with visual indications of different priorities.
- **Todo Expansion**: Expand a todo to see or edit its details.
- **Task Deletion**: Remove todos as needed.
- **Persistence**: Uses the Web Storage API (localStorage) to save and retrieve projects and todos, ensuring data persistence across page reloads.
- **Tools**: HTML, CSS, JavaScript, Webpack, date-fns library for date manipulation.
